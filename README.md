# Tower Of Hanoi Puzzle Solver

## Description
This project is develped to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem as a puzzle game using Python. It uses the concept of stacks to represent the towers and nodes to represent the disks.

## Concepts Applied
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Data Structures (Stacks, Nodes)

## Game Rules
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it on another
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk

## Features
- command-line gameplay
- Object-oriented design with Stack and Node classes
- Visual representation of tower states
- Move counter with optimal solution comparison
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling




## Output
Displays the steps to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.
